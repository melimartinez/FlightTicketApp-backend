## Project Description

The Spaceship Enterprises Flight Ticket App, is a full-stack web application designed to meet the ever-changing demands of our clients, passengers and guests interested in space travel. It allows passengers/guests to view all the upcoming flights available and book a ticket that best suits their trip schedule. They can also filter flights based on certain conditions once they are registered with an account.
